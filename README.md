## 1. Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

This documentation provides an overview of a simple Java Point of Sale (POS) system created using Apache NetBeans. The system is designed for handling transactions in a retail or restaurant setting. It allows users to add items to a shopping cart, calculate the total, and generate a bill. This documentation covers the functionality, installation, and usage of the POS system.

## 2. Project Overview<a name="project-overview"></a>

### 2.1. Features

The Java POS system (Version 1.0.0) offers the following features:

- Add items to the shopping cart with quantity and price.
- Calculate the total cost of items in the cart.
- Display a bill with item details, subtotal, payment, and balance.
- Remove items from the cart.
- Simple user interface for easy interaction.

### 2.2. Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- Java Swing for the graphical user interface.
- Apache NetBeans IDE for development.

## 3. Installation<a name="installation"></a>

To run this Java POS system on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

2. Download and install Apache NetBeans or any Java IDE of your choice.

3. Create a new Java project in your IDE and copy the provided code into the project.

4. Build and run the project.

## 4. Usage<a name="usage"></a>

### 4.1. Adding Items

- To add items to the shopping cart, click the respective buttons (e.g., "Quarter/2Pc (HC)").

- The quantity of the selected item can be increased by clicking the "Add" button multiple times.

### 4.2. Removing Items

- To remove an item from the shopping cart, select the item in the table and click the "Remove" button.

### 4.3. Making a Payment

- Enter the amount paid by the customer in the "Cash" field.

- Click the "Calculate Balance" button to calculate the balance to be returned to the customer.

### 4.4. Generating a Bill

- Click the "Generate Bill" button to create a bill with item details, subtotal, payment, and balance.

- The bill is displayed in the text area at the bottom of the window.

## 5. Code Structure<a name="code-structure"></a>

The code is organized as follows:

- The `MainFrame` class represents the main application window and contains event handlers for buttons and table interactions.

- The `addTable` method is used to add items to the shopping cart table.

- The `tot` method calculates the total cost of items in the cart.

- The `paymentActionPerformed` method handles the payment button click event.

- The `jButton7ActionPerformed` method generates the bill.

- The `jButton8ActionPerformed` method calculates the balance.

- Buttons from `jButton1` to `jButton6` handle the addition of specific items to the cart.

- The `jButton9ActionPerformed` method removes items from the cart.
